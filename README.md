# Interactive code examples

_for documentation, education and fun_ 🎉

Codapi is a platform for embedding interactive code snippets directly into your product documentation, online course or blog post.

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ def greet(name):              │
│   print(f"Hello, {name}!")    │
│                               │
│ greet("World")                │
└───────────────────────────────┘
  Run ►  Edit  ✓ Done
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ Hello, World!                 │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

Codapi manages sandboxes (isolated execution environments) and provides an API to execute code in these sandboxes. It also provides a JavaScript widget [codapi-js](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi-js) for easier integration.

Highlights:

-   Automatically converts static code examples into mini-playgrounds.
-   Lightweight and easy to integrate.
-   Sandboxes for any programming language, database, or software.
-   Open source. Uses the permissive Apache-2.0 license.

For an introduction to Codapi, see this post: [Interactive code examples for fun and profit](https://antonz.org/code-examples/).

## Installation

See [Installing Codapi](docs/install.md) for details.

## Usage

See [API](docs/api.md) to run sandboxed code using the HTTP API.

See [codapi-js](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi-js) to embed the JavaScript widget into a web page.
